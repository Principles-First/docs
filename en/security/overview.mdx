## Our Security Commitment

Moss is built with security as a foundational principle. We understand that our platform processes sensitive user interactions and business data, and we take that responsibility seriously.

This documentation outlines the security measures implemented in Moss to protect your data and your users.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

Moss employs multiple layers of security controls:

| Layer                | Protection                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**   | JWT tokens, API keys, and SSO via Clerk                  |
| **Authorization**    | Organization-based access control, session verification  |
| **Data Protection**  | Encryption in transit (TLS), sensitive data redaction    |
| **Audit Logging**    | Comprehensive request/response logging with sanitization |
| **Input Validation** | Schema validation on all API endpoints                   |

### Multi-Tenancy Isolation

Every Moss application is isolated at the organization level:

- **Database Isolation** - All queries filter by organization ID
- **API Isolation** - JWT tokens scope access to specific organizations
- **Data Isolation** - Users cannot access data from other organizations

## Compliance Commitments

Moss is actively pursuing industry-standard security certifications:

| Certification     | Description                                          | Status      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Security, availability, and confidentiality controls | In Progress |
| **ISO 27001**     | Information security management system               | In Progress |
| **EU AI Act**     | AI system transparency and accountability            | In Progress |
