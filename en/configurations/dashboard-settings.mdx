## Overview

The [Moss Dashboard](https://dashboard.viamoss.ai) provides a web interface for managing application-level settings. These settings serve as defaults that can be overridden by SDK initialization or runtime configuration.

<Tip>
    Dashboard settings are ideal for application-wide defaults, security
    policies, and settings that should apply to all users.
</Tip>

---

## Application Information

View and manage your application's metadata and identity settings.

### Application Name

Your application's display name in the dashboard. This field is currently read-only.

### Application ID

Your unique application identifier. Use this when integrating the SDK.

### Created Date

When your application was created.

### UI Language

Controls the language displayed to end users in the SDK interface.

**Default:** Auto (detects user's browser language)

Navigate to **Settings > Application Information** and select from the Language dropdown.

<Info>
    When set to "Auto", Moss will automatically detect and use the user's
    preferred browser language. This can be overridden via SDK initialization.
</Info>

---

## General Settings

Configure your application's core AI assistant features.

### Enable Vision

Allow the SDK to process and analyze screenshots and visual content. When enabled, the AI assistant can "see" the user's screen and provide more contextual guidance.

**Default:** `true`

Navigate to **Settings > General Settings > Core Features** and toggle "Enable Vision".

**Use cases:**
- Visual troubleshooting
- UI element identification
- Screenshot-based guidance

<Tip>
    Enable this feature if your users need help finding specific UI elements or
    if you want the AI to provide visual context.
</Tip>

### Enable Session Replay

Record and upload user sessions for replay in the dashboard. This allows you to review user interactions and debug issues.

**Default:** `true`

Navigate to **Settings > General Settings > Core Features** and toggle "Enable Session Replay".

**What's recorded:**
- User interactions (clicks, inputs, navigation)
- DOM structure changes
- Timestamps and session metadata

<Warning>
    Session recordings may contain sensitive user data. Ensure you have
    appropriate privacy policies and user consent.
</Warning>

### Enable Screen History for AI

Include user action history (clicks, inputs, navigation) and DOM changes in the AI's context. This provides the AI with a richer understanding of the user's journey.

**Default:** `true`

Navigate to **Settings > General Settings > Core Features** and toggle "Enable Screen History for AI".

**Benefits:**
- More contextual AI responses
- Better understanding of user intent
- Improved multi-step guidance

### AI Assistant Instructions

Provide custom instructions to help the AI assistant navigate your application or provide context not available through documentation.

**Default:** Empty
**Maximum:** 30,000 characters

<Note>
    This setting is **Dashboard and API only** - it cannot be configured via SDK
    initialization.
</Note>

Navigate to **Settings > General Settings > AI Assistant Instructions** and enter your custom instructions in the textarea.

**What to include:**
- Specific navigation patterns unique to your application
- Important UI context or workflow information
- Special considerations or edge cases
- Terminology or concepts specific to your domain

**Example:**

```
When users ask about 'dashboard', always guide them to the Analytics
section first, not the Overview. The main navigation menu collapses
on mobile devices and requires clicking the hamburger icon in the
top-left corner.
```

<Tip>
    Use clear, concise language. The AI will incorporate these instructions when
    helping users.
</Tip>

## User Experience

Configure planning features and session behavior.

### Planning Configuration

Enable AI-powered multi-step planning for complex user tasks.

#### Enable Planning

Turn on/off the planning feature entirely.

**Default:** `false`

Navigate to **Settings > User Experience > Planning Configuration** and toggle "Enable Planning".

When enabled, the AI can break down complex tasks into multiple steps and execute them sequentially.

#### Maximum Steps

The maximum number of steps allowed in a single plan.

**Default:** `10`
**Range:** 1-20

<Info>
    Higher values allow for more complex multi-step tasks but may take longer to
    complete.
</Info>

#### Allow User Skip

Allow users to skip individual steps in a plan.

**Default:** Enabled

When enabled, users can choose to skip steps they've already completed or want to handle manually.

#### Show Plan Overview

Display the full plan overview to users before execution.

**Default:** Enabled

Shows users what the AI plans to do before taking action, improving transparency and trust.

### Session Behavior

Configure how user sessions are managed and timed out.

#### Inactivity Timeout

Time in minutes before an inactive session is considered expired.

**Default:** 30 minutes

After this period of inactivity, a new session will be created for the user.

#### Maximum Session Age

Maximum session duration in hours, regardless of activity.

**Default:** 2 hours

Sessions will automatically expire after this duration, even if the user is active.

#### Show Notifications

Display notifications when starting new sessions.

**Default:** Enabled

When enabled, users will see a notification when a new session begins.

---

## Security

Control access and security settings for your SDK.

### Domain Access Control

Restrict which domains can use your SDK to prevent unauthorized usage.

**Default:** Empty (all domains allowed)

<Note>This setting is **Dashboard only**.</Note>

**How it works:**
- If the list is empty, the SDK works on any domain
- If domains are specified, the SDK only works on those domains
- Wildcards are not supported

**Example allowed domains:**

```
app.example.com
staging.example.com
localhost:3000
```

<Warning>
    Be careful when restricting domains. Make sure to include all environments
    where your application runs (production, staging, development).
</Warning>

---

## Developer Options

Advanced settings for developers and technical configuration.

### API Keys

Manage API keys for SDK authentication.

<Note>This setting is **Dashboard only**.</Note>

#### Current API Key

Your active production API key. The full key is only shown once when generated.

<Warning>
    Your API key is sensitive. Store it securely and never commit it to version
    control.
</Warning>

#### Regenerate API Key

Create a new API key and invalidate the old one.

<Danger>
    Regenerating your API key will immediately invalidate the old key. Any
    applications using the old key will stop working.
</Danger>

### Vector Store Configuration

Choose which documentation system to use for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

<Note>This setting is **Dashboard only**.</Note>

**Default:** V1 System (for new applications)

**Options:**
- **Legacy System:** Uses documentation_records table
- **V1 System (New):** Uses three-tier documentation system (sources, pages, chunks)

<Info>
    V1 provides better organization with sources, pages, and chunks. It also
    preserves full page content.
</Info>

**Before switching:**
- Ensure your documentation is ingested into the new system
- Test RAG search results after switching
- You can switch back anytime if needed

### Danger Zone

Irreversible actions that affect your application.

<Note>This setting is **Dashboard only**.</Note>

#### Delete Application

Permanently delete your application and all associated data.

**Status:** Coming Soon

<Danger>
    When enabled, this action will permanently remove all data including
    sessions, users, and knowledge base documents. This cannot be undone.
</Danger>
