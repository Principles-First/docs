# SDK Overview

The Moss SDK embeds an AI-powered assistant into your web application. It captures page context, communicates with the Moss backend, and renders an interactive assistant UI — all without affecting your existing styles or layout.

## How It Works

When a user asks a question, the SDK:

1. **Captures page context** — DOM structure, visible text, and an optional screenshot
2. **Sends it to the Moss backend** — along with the user's message and conversation history
3. **Receives AI-generated guidance** — which may include text responses or step-by-step instructions
4. **Renders the response** — in a chat modal with optional element highlighting and coach marks

The entire UI renders inside a [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM), so Moss styles never conflict with your application's CSS.

## Integration Methods

The SDK supports two integration methods:

| Method | Best For | Install |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **NPM Package** | React applications | `npm install @viamoss/moss-sdk` |
| **CDN Script Tag** | Any web application | `<script src="...">` |

Both methods provide the same assistant UI and functionality. Choose based on your tech stack.

## What Gets Captured

When the assistant needs context about the current page, the SDK captures:

- **Visible text content** from the DOM
- **Interactive elements** (buttons, links, form fields) with their labels and states
- **A screenshot** of the page (configurable: full page or viewport only)
- **Page URL and metadata**

    All data is sent over HTTPS to your configured Moss backend. No data is stored in the browser beyond the current session.
